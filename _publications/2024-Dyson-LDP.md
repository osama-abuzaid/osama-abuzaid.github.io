The main motivation of the present work is to investigate the asymptotic behavior as κ→0+ of multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLEκ. We show that this process with the common parameterization satisfies a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) in the Hausdorff metric with non-negative rate function, the multiradial Loewner energy. We also characterize the large-time behavior of curves with finite energy and zero energy (whose driving functions correspond to the trigonometric Calogero-Moser system).
The first half of this article is of independent interest regardless of SLE theory. It is devoted to proving a finite-time LDP for Dyson Brownian motion on the circle for a fixed number n of particles as the coupling parameter β=8/κ tends to ∞. To our knowledge, in the literature large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion has only been considered for fixed β and as n tends to ∞. While the non-Lipschitz drift precludes the application of the Freidlin-Wentzell theorem, we show that the rate function has the same form as in Freidlin-Wentzell theory for diffusions with uniformly Lipschitz drift.
In the second half of this article, we turn to proving an LDP for multiradial SLEκ. Here, the main technical difficulty is that the SLEκ curves have a common target point, preventing the usual configurational, or global, approach. Instead, we make careful use of the contraction principle from the LDP for Dyson Brownian motion (proven in the first part of the article), combined with topological results in Loewner theory: we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are always disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint. A key to this is obtained from a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function.
