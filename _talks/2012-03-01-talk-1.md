Abstract: Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE(κ) is a one-parameter family of random curves arising from two dimensional conformal geometry, which in the limit κ->0 converge to a deterministic curve. Large deviation principle quantifies the exponential rate of convergence and has recently been established for chordal and multichordal SLE(κ) curves. We consider an analogous model, multiradial SLE(κ), consisting of multiple interacting SLE(κ) curves targeting the same interior point. It is closely related to Dyson Brownian motion on the circle which can be thought of as an interactive particle system in a heat bath. Here, the κ->0 limit corresponds to infinite repulsion for Dyson Brownian motion. We prove a large deviation principle both for Dyson Brownian motion (generalizing Schilder's theorem for the usual 1D-Brownian motion) and, using this, for multiradial SLE(κ). This is joint work with V. Healey and E. Peltola.
