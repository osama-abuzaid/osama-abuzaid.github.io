Abstract: A self-avoiding random walk is a uniformly sampled injective path of N steps in an infinite (square) lattice started from a fixed vertex. One of the main open problems is the existence of a unique weak limit of the random paths as N tends to infinity. I will share my on-going attempts at understanding the limiting object by reducing the analysis to so called initial box patterns and their properties."
