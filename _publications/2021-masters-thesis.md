This thesis is a self-contained exposition of the self-avoiding random walk model with special focus on the walks on the hexagonal lattice. Self-avoiding walks are non-intersecting paths on a lattice, and the model assigns uniform probability on the set of self-avoiding walks of fixed length with a given starting point. The model was first suggested by chemist Nobel laureate Paul Flory to study long polymer chains, and has since caught the attention of mathematicians due to the complexity of the subject despite the simplicity of the model.
		
We prove classical results of self-avoiding walks in the case of walks in the hexagonal lattice, such as the Hammersley-Welsh bound, Kesten's pattern theorem, and the existence of infinite self-avoiding half-space random walks. The parafermionic observable for hexagonal lattice is reviewed and used to derive the value of the connective constant, which measures the exponential growth rate of the number of walks of a given length.
		
The proofs mostly follow existing literature with necessary modifications to make them work in the hexagonal lattice. An exception to this is the proof of Kesten's pattern theorem, which has been streamlined considerably. We also review open problems and refer to recent developments in the subject.
